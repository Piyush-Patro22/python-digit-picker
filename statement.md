Problem statement:
The problem is to build a simple Python program that prints the numbers from 1 to a user-given value n, joins these numbers together into one continuous string of digits, and then allows the user to select and view a single digit at a given position in that string.

Scope of the project:
The project is intentionally small and focused on basic Python concepts like loops, lists, string concatenation, and indexing. It does not handle advanced topics such as error handling, very large inputs, or graphical interfaces, but it can be extended later to include validation and more user-friendly behavior.​

Target users:
The main target users are beginners who have just started learning Python and want a hands-on example of how to work with numbers and strings together. It can also be useful for students completing school or college lab exercises on loops, arrays/lists, and basic input–output.​

High-level features:
Accepts a positive integer n from the user and prints the sequence from 1 to n in a single line.​

Stores each number in a list, converts the list elements to strings, and concatenates them into one long digit string.​

Asks the user for a position y and outputs the digit present at that 1-based index in the concatenated string, illustrating direct index access on strings.
