# python-digit-picker
A beginner-friendly Python program that takes an integer n from the user.  Prints the numbers from 1 to n in a single line and stores them in a list.​  Concatenates these numbers into one long string.​  Asks the user for a position y and prints the y‑th digit from that concatenated string.
